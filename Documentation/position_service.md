### double randMToN(double M, double N)

Declared in the file position_service.cpp

@brief this function given two inputs calculates one random number in the interval in between. Both the numbers taken as inputs and the random number generated are integers. The random number is chosen with the function void rand(), a library function of the C language that generates a pseudo random number. In order to have the random number in a given interval I first multiply the random number generated by RAND_MAX that is a constant that represent the maximum random number generated by rand and then I divide by N-M that gives me a random number in the interval [0;(N-M)]. In order to translate it and have it in the interval [M;N] I sum it to M.

@param M is the minimum number of the interval

@param N is the maximum number of the interval

@retval the random number

### myrandom (rt2_assignment1::RandomPosition::Request &req, rt2_assignment1::RandomPosition::Response &res)

Declared in the file position_service.cpp

@brief : This function is called when I have a request, it reads the request and as a response sends the coordinates of the goal position and orientation. This function receives as input the server request and a pointer to the server response. The server requests are the ranges of the x, y in which I want to generate the random position. It then calls the function randMtoN to generate a random number in a given interval for the x, y and theta.

@param : rt2_assignment1::RandomPosition::Request &req
